# Funda Frontend Assessment


## How do I run this thing

- Run Node.js server: `cd server && npm i && node server`
- Run Angular project: `npm i && ng s`
- Open browser on `localhost:4200`
- Done!

## Personal goals

As with every exercise I do, I want to set myself a few new things to learn from. This time around It was fairly simple. 

- Start project with visual documentation
- Smooth themes, with transisions
- Use Angular's new rendering/compiling engine, Ivy
- Robust application, no need to ever reload to get back on track.

I decided I wanted to try out Miro for some "visual documentation". In the end of the day its simply my though process in digital sticky notes. I purposefully went into this without and struture in mind.

As you can see, there are both cut content and ideas that have changed during development. If I were to onboard more members on the project I believe having a visualisation of my thought process will be much more helpful than re-drawing on a white-board again and again and risk losing information.

Theming was pretty simple, but last time I tried messing around with it was years ago, and I was much less knowledgeable on the subject, I struggled. This time I feel like i succeeded!

Ivy was very quick to not want to work with me, so I decided to just disable it. Perhaps another time!

I added some "god-mode" tools to switch between light-/dark mode and a refresh with a random listing option. If my application was not robust enough, these acitons would be able to expose that.
